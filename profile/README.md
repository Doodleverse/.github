## üåü Overview
Currently, there are 3 packages:

* Dash-Doodler
  * For fast, interactive segmentation of imagery
  * For creation of training datasets for training Machine-Learning-based image segmentation models, for example Segmentation Gym
* Segmentation Gym
  * A neural gym for training image segmentation models based on fully convolutional models based on UNets
* Segmentation Zoo
  * A repository of pre-trained models

Packages are compatible, and share an underlying design and data structures
